**第一轮:电话采访**

*   Tell me about yourself.
*   Database schema design: given the form user, follow and publish. The user will have a user id, user name, post id and follow-up id. The Follow will have follower_id, followee_id. The post will have post_id, post_text and post_media.
*   He asked me if I had done any caching, queuing and background tasks. I have no contact with commercial network applications, so I don't know what background he asked. Let's say it's the Internet. Because this role is related to the Internet, I told him everything I know.
*   Then he asked me if I had used any Web API or NoSQL projects. I said that I used an open source PHP class in a project, but I'm not sure whether this is a network application programming interface. I said that I had not participated in any NoSQL project.

一周后，我收到一封被拒绝的邮件。我试图寻求反馈，但没有得到任何反馈。
