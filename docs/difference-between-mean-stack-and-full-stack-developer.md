[**平均栈开发者**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-mean-stack/) **:**

从事 JavaScript 技术开发网络应用程序的信息技术专业人员被称为 MEAN 堆栈开发人员。

MEAN 指

*   m 先生云娥[【蒙戈布】](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mongodb-an-introduction/) (NoSQLā）
*   E stands for [express](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-express/) (the back-end web application framework of node.js)
*   A stands for [angular](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/angularjs-tutorials/) (open source front-end web framework based on JavaScript to develop single-page application front-end framework)
*   N stands for [node.js](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nodejs-tutorials/) (developing open source and cross-platform runtime environment on server side)

**Mean Stack 开发的优点:**

*   It helps to develop websites/applications faster and easier.
*   This only uses a unified language for stack development.
*   It helps to develop applications quickly.
*   It uses very low memory as overhead.
*   Organize the whole application.
*   Help to avoid every unnecessary foreshadowing.
*   Its Mongo DataBase is used for cloud storage.

**平均堆栈开发的缺点:**

*   它不适合大规模应用。
*   它没有具体的 JavaScript 程序编码准则。
*   当你已经使用 Mean Stack 技术开发了网站时，很难再回到旧数据。
*   在业务逻辑中，它与服务器的隔离性很差。
*   它失去了记录，也没有备份设备。

[**全栈开发者**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-full-stack-development/) **:**

从事服务器端和客户端软件开发的信息技术专业人员被称为全栈开发人员，他们需要一套技术知识。

全栈开发人员的先决条件:

*   超文本标记语言
*   半铸钢ˌ钢性铸铁(Cast Semi-Steel)
*   JavaScript 角度 JS 阿力视图(view)
*   PHP、ASP、Python、Node.js
*   范雎范雎 mysql、sqlite、mongodb 蒙戈布

这样的数据库

**前端或客户端软件:**

*   [HTML](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-tutorials/)
*   CSS
*   [自举](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bootstrap-tutorials/)
*   [JavaScript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-tutorial/)
*   [XML](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xml-basics/)
*   jQuery
*   有角的
*   骨气。射流研究…
*   恩伯。射流研究…

**后端或服务器端软件:**

*   [【PHP】](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/php/)
*   【ASP】
*   [【c11】](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/)
*   [](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/)

**全栈开发的优点:**

*   In a development project, you can master all the technologies involved.
*   Rapid prototyping is very good.
*   It helps every member of your team.
*   We can reduce the project cost.
*   We can reduce the time for your team members to communicate.
*   We can switch front-end and back-end development according to their needs.
*   We can also learn about the coming technologies and new technologies.

**全栈开发的弊端:**

*   In the project, the choice of solution may be wrong.
*   You can rely on development skills as an alternative.
*   The solution can hold the risk of key people.

**MEAN STACK DEVELOPER 与 Full stack developer 的区别:**

<figure class="table">

| **s . no .** | **MEAN STACK DEVELOPER** | **Full STACK DEVELOPER** |
| 01。 | 一名从事 Java Script 语言技术开发的信息技术专业人员被称为平均堆栈开发人员，其中意思是指的是 MongoDB、Expressjs、AngularJs、NodeJS . | IT professionals who are engaged in server-side and client-side software development are called full-stack developers who need a set of technical knowledge. |
| 02。 | MEAN stack development is a set of four full stack technologies, which can be used to make a full stack application. It is an indispensable part of full stack development. | Full-stack developers know all the web development frameworks, technologies and programming languages needed to develop a fully functional website. |
| 03。 | In this regard, it is widely convenient for developers to use the Angular front-end framework. | In this case, developers can use any front-end technology from many front-end development frameworks. |
| 04。 | In this case, developers are allowed to use node.js to write server-side code in JavaScript. | But in this case, developers can benefit from a robust server-side programming language. |
| 05。 | There is only one database, Mongo DB. | In this case, developers are using a large number of databases, such as MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle and so on. |
| 06。 | In these development enterprises, it simulates full-stack development by writing two sides of programming code with JavaScript. | In these development enterprises, we can get both front-end and back-end. |
| 07。 | MEAN stack generally refers to the full stack development framework. | Full stack generally refers to the full stack development process based on the above technology. |
