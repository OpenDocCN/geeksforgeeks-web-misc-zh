**WPF(Windows Presentation Foundation):**WPF，顾名思义，是一个用于开发 Windows 或桌面客户端应用的 UI 框架。这是与一起使用的图形用户界面框架的最新方法。NET 框架。它的引入是为了开发运行在视窗操作系统上的视窗客户端应用程序，以及下一代视窗窗体。它具有开发、运行、执行、管理和处理 Windows 客户端应用程序所需的所有功能。

它通常提供综合或集成用户界面、2D 和三维图形、数字媒体和文档的整体方法。它负责开发、显示和操作用户界面、文档、图像等。，在 Windows 7 和更高版本的操作系统中。它是当前开发 windows 应用程序的平台。

**WinForms (Windows 窗体应用程序):** WinForms，顾名思义，基本上是引入到。NET 框架。在 WPF 和 Silverlight 之前，它是的主要 API。NET，用于构建图形用户界面。除了运行时和操作系统，它不需要任何类型的支持来开发独立的应用程序。

人们可以开发易于部署、更新、管理和离线工作的应用程序，同时连接到互联网。WinForms 的开发非常简单，因为它只基于 UI 控件在画布上的拖放放置。它是开发桌面应用程序的旧平台。

| --- | --- |
| It is based on DirectX that XAML supports it. | It provides access to native windows libraries of commonly used controls. |
| It uses markup language to design UI, allowing complex user interface design. | It is designed without using markup language. In fact, it is designed with event-driven controls. |
| Compared with WinForms, it has faster rendering speed, lower complexity and more support. | Compared with WPF, the rendering speed is slower. |
| You can develop and design both windows applications and web applications. | Can only be used to develop and design windows applications. |
| It has unlimited UI customization, and the control can be easily customized because it is completely written from scratch. | In this case, the control is limited and difficult to customize. |
| It is easier to separate UO from backend logic. | It is difficult to separate UI from backend logic. |
| Its built-in feature "user interface virtualization" allows you to handle large data sets. | It has no "user interface virtualization" function. |
| It takes up more RAM than WinForms. | It takes up less memory. |
| When an application needs multiple media types, creates a skin-like UI, binds to XML, and develops a desktop application with a web-like navigation style, it is considered to be good. | If you want to develop an application without adding too many modern functions and more online resources, it is considered good. |
| Compared with WinForms, it provides effective and fully supported data binding. | It provides data binding in a limited way. Therefore, it is not as effective as WPF. |
| It also provides rich, interactive, animated, hardware-accelerated, vector 2D and 3D functions for developing applications. | Compared with WPF, it does not provide any rich, interactive, animated, hardware-accelerated, vector 2D and 3D functions. |
| Compared with WinForms, using WPF is a bit difficult, time-consuming and complicated. | WinForms is very simple, because controls can be easily used, and compared with WPF, it is less time-consuming and less troublesome. |
| It has a built-in storyboard function and animation model, and it has the ability to declaratively use business objects in the UI. | It does not provide such a function. |
