网页设计，顾名思义，就是设计网站。设计网站相当复杂，也令人望而生畏，即很难处理。网页设计是一个创造性的过程，它不仅影响受众，还影响排名和个人品牌。它只会影响整个网络。设计基本上是根据计划创造一些东西来展示它的外观和功能。网页设计是相似的，因为它也包括设计网站和通过网络浏览器通过互联网向最终用户呈现内容。

**网页设计要素:**设计网站可能看起来很容易，但实际上，并不像看起来那么容易。在设计网站时，人们必须记住网站的外观和功能。一个好的网页设计只会给观众留下深刻的印象，因为这种印象要么会留在你的网站上并了解你的业务，要么会离开你的网站并寻找另一个。网页设计基本上有两个要素，即视觉要素和功能要素。

**1。视觉元素:**

视觉元素仅仅意味着我们看到的事物的一个方面或表现。视觉元素多种多样，部分给出如下:

*   **Layout:** Layout simply indicates the overall structure of the website, including graphics, advertisements, text, title, menu, content, etc. The layout of the website is very important because it helps to guide users and tell them where they want to see. A good layout will also make it easy for a person to get information and give a clear navigation path. Now there are different layouts to choose from, and people can choose any one of them, because there is no such rule when choosing layouts.
*   **Shape:** Shape simply marks the boundary of content. It also plays an important role in brand building. Every geometry or figure has its own meaning, which influences our thinking. Shape just represents a concept, creates movement, influences composition, helps to create complex pictures and paintings, and provides depth and texture. It also helps to increase the number of visitors to the website, because the appearance will affect people, thus improving your business.
*   **Color:** It is very necessary and important to choose the right color for web page design. It can be considered as a powerful factor for successful website development. This is a way to connect users or visitors and improve brand recognition. The effective use of color attracts people and increases the number of tourists. People can choose different colors according to their own choices.
*   **Pictures and icons:** Pictures and icons are the best way to improve the user experience of your website and attract users' attention. This is the best and most compatible way to present information and explain concepts. It makes the website look more professional and interesting. It also supports text content and provides a quick summary of the text.

**2。功能要素:**

功能元素仅仅意味着网站功能的方面或表示。它只是代表了网站能做什么以及它是如何工作的。功能要素多种多样，部分给出如下:

*   **Navigation:** Navigation is simply the process of monitoring the movement around the website or screen. It just directs visitors or users to different webpages and allows searching websites for longer. This is one of the best ways to determine whether the website is working properly.
*   **User interaction:** The user interface is very important, because it will either increase visitors to your website or break the user base. It just attracts users and simplifies their activities. It is basically a point where users interact with the website, such as scrolling, clicking, typing and so on.
*   **Animation:** Animation plays a very important role in attracting more users and improving user experience. Animation is just a demonstration of a product or image, most of which is made by computer-generated images. It allows a person to do more things with less resources, interact with others in a better way and communicate clearly and effectively.
