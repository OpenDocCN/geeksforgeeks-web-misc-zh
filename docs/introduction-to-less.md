LESS 是一个简单的 CSS 预处理程序，可以为网站创建可管理、可定制和可重用的样式表。LESS 是一种动态样式表语言，增加了 CSS 的工作能力。LESS 兼容跨浏览器。CSS 预处理器是一种脚本语言，它改进了 CSS，并被编译成常规的 CSS 语法，以便网络浏览器使用。这还提供了变量、函数、混合和操作等功能，使我们能够构建动态 CSS。

**为什么用 LESS？**

*   LESS helps to create cleaner and cross-browser compatible CSS faster and easier.
*   It is designed for dynamic use and uses JavaScript that compiles faster than other CSS preprocessors.
*   LESS saves code in a standard way for easy reading and modification.
*   Fewer variables make code maintenance faster.

LESS 最初是由 Alexis Sellier 在 2009 年设计的。LESS 是一种易于学习和理解的开源语言。LESS 的第一个版本是用 Ruby 写的。而在接下来的版本中，Ruby 的使用被更简单的语言 JavaScript 所取代。

**LESS 特性:**

*   Less is more concise and makes the code easy to read, so it can be organized by.
*   Styles can be defined, and then they can be reused throughout the code.
*   LESS is a superset of CSS based on simple and complete language JavaScript.
*   LESS is an active tool to solve the problem of code redundancy.

**LESS 的优势:**

*   LESS can easily generate CSS that can work across different browsers.
*   LESS allows users to write better and better organized code with the help of nesting.
*   Fewer variables make code maintenance faster.
*   By referencing classes in the rule set, LESS makes it easy for users to use classes again and again.
*   LESS allows users to use operations, making coding faster and saving a lot of time.

**LESS 的缺点:**

*   For new users, learning LESS is a very tiring job without CSS knowledge.
*   Because of the tight coupling between modules, more efforts are needed to reuse them and test the dependent modules.
*   Compared with other older preprocessors, LESS has fewer frameworks like SASS, which is composed of Compass, Gravity and Susy frameworks.
