**Web App Development:**Web-App Development 一词由三个词组成，即:

*   **Web:** refers to websites, webpages or anything that works on the Internet.
*   **app:** refers to application software.
*   **Development:** Build applications from scratch.

网络应用程序开发=创建在互联网上运行的应用程序，即网站

**Web App 开发可以分为两种类型:**

*   **前端开发:**用户直接交互的网站部分称为前端。它也被称为应用程序的“客户端”。它包括用户直接体验到的一切:文本颜色和样式、图像、图形和表格、按钮、颜色和导航菜单。HTML、CSS 和 Javascript 是用于前端开发的语言。当网站、网络应用程序或移动应用程序打开时，浏览器屏幕上看到的所有内容的结构、设计、行为和内容都由前端开发人员实现。响应能力和性能是前端的两个主要目标。开发人员必须确保网站具有响应性，即无论屏幕大小如何，网站的任何部分都不应出现异常。

*   **后端开发:**后端是网站的服务器端。它存储和整理数据，并确保网站客户端的一切正常运行。它是网站中你看不到也无法与之互动的部分。它是软件中不与用户直接接触的部分。后端设计人员开发的部分和特性由用户通过前端应用程序间接访问。像编写应用编程接口、创建库以及在没有用户界面甚至没有科学编程系统的情况下使用系统组件等活动也包含在后端中。

**网络应用开发的优势:**

*   **Run on any OS:** It is programmed to run on any OS. It must be properly adapted to iOS, Android and Windows Phone-and other operating systems.
*   **Run with simple URL:** These applications run on the device's own browser through simple URL.
*   **No need to download:** They don't need to be downloaded and installed from application stores such as Google Play or Apple App Store. This means saving money, because direct links through Internet applications are free.
*   **No need to update like app:** They can also open the website. This means that they don't need to be updated like ordinary applications.
*   **Cost-effective:** The biggest benefit you can get from it is its price. Network application development is a cheaper application development. It includes establishing one or more links between the device and the website. Developing a native application or interpreting an application requires higher cost, but the chances of success are much greater.

**web app 开发的弊端**

*   **If the website doesn't respond, there will be problems:** Website response means that the website data is displayed correctly on every platform and screen of every size.
*   If there is any problem with your website, your application will be in trouble. If you don't have a high-quality company website, don't think your web application will run perfectly. For example, if the web address of the website takes some time to load, or if there are uncomfortable "cookies" when entering the website, accessing it through the device will bring the same problem. This problem is not inherent in your network application. It is located inside the website development.
*   **Internet connection is mandatory:** Internet connection will be absolutely necessary. Otherwise, you will not be able to browse the website.
*   It will also lose its popularity because it will not be displayed in the store.
*   In addition, there are some access restrictions for some hardware functions of the running device.
