| Mobile applications are developed for a wider range of users. | Compared with mobile applications, network applications are developed for a smaller range of users. |
| New apps can be downloaded from the app store. | The application will be updated on the website. |
| It is not easy to create responsive design for small screen devices such as mobile devices and tablets. | For large-screen devices such as desktops and notebooks, it is easy to carry out relative design coding. |
| When downloading applications and multimedia, the capacity of mobile storage is limited, so it is sometimes difficult to test mobile applications. | The storage capacity of desktop or laptop is unlimited. |
| Mobile applications sometimes do not need any Internet connection, but the speed is very important, the connection quality is very important, and the speed of LTE connection, etc. | Web app generally need an Internet connection to perform any tasks. |
| Testing mobile applications is quite complicated, because different mobile devices have different functions and a larger number. | Because of the functionality of desktop, it is easy to test web applications. |
| The test team has to check the performance of mobile devices on fully charged devices and low-powered devices, because applications that run out of battery life will soon be deleted. | There is no battery life problem. |
| People have to consider different screen sizes, different OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), storage capacity and so on. , in the mobile phone application test. | In web app testing, people don't think about such things. |
| The test team had to focus on the interaction between the mobile device and the user's actions, voice and environment, eye movements and so on. Because it provides a variety of options to perform operations. | The test team doesn't need to pay attention to the interaction between network equipment and user movement, the direction that users pay attention to, the movement of eyes, etc. Because it provides fewer operation options. |
