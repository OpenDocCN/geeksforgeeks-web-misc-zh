**什么是混合应用程序:**

*   Hybrid application is a software application that combines elements of **native application** and **network application** .
*   It is a combination of network application and local application, which needs to be downloaded to your device like a local application, but the program used to build the hybrid application is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
*   The browsers accessed by our devices are HTML, JavaScript and native API for specific hardware.
*   It can run online and offline. If the hybrid software does not depend on the data in the database, it can be used offline.
*   It runs across various platforms, but it needs to deploy the wrapper of the application.
*   Examples of mixed applications: Uber, Ola, Twitter, etc.

**什么是原生应用:**

*   Native applications are created by software programs (such as java, kotlin, ruby, etc.) running on specific devices and platforms.
*   We need to download the native app from the app store (Google play, Apple's store) because it doesn't run in the browser. Unlike our smart phones, in our smart phones, every application installed from the app store can access the icon on the home screen of our device.
*   Native application is specially developed for a platform, which can access all functions of our equipment, such as camera, file manager, contacts, global positioning system, etc.
*   They are various platforms on which we can build native applications such as desktops, smart phones and smart watches.
*   Native applications can be notified to work offline through the system.
*   Examples of native applications: Facebook, WhatsApp, etc.

**什么是网络应用** :

*   A web application is a kind of software or program that can be run and accessed by a web browser, which is different from a native application running on a specific device.
*   We don't need any special SDK to develop web applications. The front part is mainly created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, bootstrap, etc. Part of the backend can use MEAN stack, Hibernate, etc.
*   Unlike the native application, the network application cannot be installed because it runs inside the browser.
*   The Web application is connected through the server. The server needs bandwidth, which helps the web application always run on the browser.
*   Display the data of the web application on the client, which takes up little disk space on the client. If the server connection is lost, the whole data may be lost.

**混合应用的优缺点:**

**优势:**

*   在这里，我们可以在各种平台上自由使用混合应用程序。
*   它可以脱机工作，也可以联机工作。
*   混合应用程序随时都有各种更新，这提高了应用程序的质量。
*   不像原生应用，为两个平台开发两个版本的成本是原生应用的两倍，开发成本更低。

**劣势:**

*   Since hybrid applications work on various platforms, the GUI or appearance may vary from platform to platform and from user to user.
*   Hybrid applications need to be tested across various platforms, and it runs to ensure the normal operation of app.

**用于混合应用的各种框架:**

**1。React Native 框架:**

*   It is the most popular framework for hybrid application development.
*   Support various IDE and tools for development.
*   The best thing about React Native is that you can see the results of the code.
*   Because the result is faster, the time efficiency is high.

**2。旋舞:**

*   Very easy to use and implement. For novice developers, it is easy to get started.
*   Flutter supports various languages, so it helps developers to use their own languages on various platforms.

**3。ion:**

*   Most suitable for mobile phone application development.
*   是它使用 html、css 和 javascript。
*   Using the open source HTML5 development platform.
*   Using a single database for mixed application development.

**4。jQuery Mobile:**

*   It is a JavaScript framework that completely depends on plug-ins available in JavaScript, such as content slider, image slider, pop-up box, etc.
*   It is easier to implement than other JavaScript libraries.
*   Programming is required in this very little code.

5.**Appcelerator Titanium:**

*   The advantage of using Appcelerator Titanium is that it uses its own API, that is, it has an independent API, which can easily access the equipment hardware.
*   It can be reused across different platforms and applications.
*   Receive UI components.
